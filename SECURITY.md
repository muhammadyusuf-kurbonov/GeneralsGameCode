## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have been informed of or discovered a security vulnerability, exploit or other flaw, please contact a developer of TheSuperHackers to report it privately. Public channels on Discord or the GitHub should be avoided, as the exploit may be taken from a public post and used before it can be patched. The best method is to contact xezon on discord. He can be reached in the [Community Outpost Discord](https://discord.gg/WzxQDZersE).
